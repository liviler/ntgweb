                        Atomic nuclei are composed of a certain number of protons Z and neutrons N.
                        A natural question is how large Z and N can be. The study of superheavy elements
                        explores the large Z limit1,2, and we are still looking for a comprehensive theoretical
                        explanation of the largest possible N for a given Z—the existence limit for the
                        neutron-rich isotopes of a given atomic species, known as the neutron dripline3.
                        The neutron dripline of oxygen (Z = 8) can be understood theoretically as the result
                        of single nucleons filling single-particle orbits confined by a mean potential, and
                        experiments confirm this interpretation. However, recent experiments on heavier
                        elements are at odds with this description. Here we show that the neutron dripline
                        from fluorine (Z = 9) to magnesium (Z = 12) can be predicted using a mechanism that
                        goes beyond the single-particle picture: as the number of neutrons increases, the
                        nuclear shape assumes an increasingly ellipsoidal deformation, leading to a higher
                        binding energy. The saturation of this effect (when the nucleus cannot be further
                        deformed) yields the neutron dripline: beyond this maximum N, the isotope is
                        unbound and further neutrons ‘drip’ out when added. Our calculations are based on a
                        recently developed effective nucleon–nucleon interaction4, for which large-scale
                        eigenvalue problems are solved using configuration-interaction simulations. The
                        results obtained show good agreement with experiments, even for excitation energies
                        of low-lying states, up to the nucleus of magnesium-40 (which has 28 neutrons). The
                        proposed mechanism for the formation of the neutron dripline has the potential to
                        stimulate further thinking in the field towards explaining nucleosynthesis with
                        neutron-rich nuclei.
